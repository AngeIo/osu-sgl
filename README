Storyboard Editor and SGL Compiler for osu!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A storyboard editor, along with a compiler for the Storyboard Generation Language written in C# 2.0, so it can be intergrated into osu! once it's done.

The SGL compiler uses Antlr for parsing and treewalking actions.
